# Early Warning System for At-Risk Student Identification

This project is designed to identify students at risk of dropping out or underperforming academically using machine learning techniques. It helps educational institutions take proactive steps to support those students early on.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Identifies at-risk students using historical data
- Implements classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, KNN)
- Provides early warning alerts based on risk scores
- User-friendly interface for analysis and prediction

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (ML algorithms)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
